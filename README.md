# Marklassian

A lightweight JavaScript library that transforms Markdown to the [Atlassian Document Format (ADF)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/). Built for easy integration with Atlassian products and APIs.

Visit our [interactive playground](https://marklassian.netlify.app/playground) to experiment with Markdown to ADF conversion in real-time.

## Features

- Convert Markdown to ADF with a single function call
- Support for the most common Markdown syntax
- TypeScript-ready with full type definitions
- Works in all modern JavaScript environments (Browsers, Node.js, Deno, Bun)
- Lightweight ([12kb gzipped and minified](https://bundlephobia.com/package/marklassian)), doesn't depend on AtlasKit dependencies

## Installation

```bash
npm install marklassian
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { markdownToAdf } from 'marklassian';

const markdown = '# Hello World';
const adf = markdownToAdf(markdown);
```

## Supported Markdown Features

- Paragraphs and line breaks
- Emphasis (bold, italic, strikethrough)
- Links and images
- Code blocks with language support
- Ordered and unordered lists with nesting
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Tables
- Task lists (GitHub Flavoured Markdown feature)

## Embedding ADF nodes

For cases where Markdown doesn't cover a required Confluence or Jira structure (macros, panels, status badges, etc.), you can embed raw ADF nodes directly inside `<adf>` tags:

```markdown
# My page

<adf>
{"type":"extension","attrs":{"extensionType":"com.atlassian.confluence.macro.core","extensionKey":"status","parameters":{"macroParams":{"title":{"value":"Done"},"colour":{"value":"Green"}}}}}
</adf>

More content here.
```

The content inside `<adf>…</adf>` must be either:

- A single JSON object with at least a `"type"` string property, or
- A JSON array of such objects

This matches the structure of a node in an ADF document's `content` array. All `attrs`, `content`, and `marks` fields are passed through unchanged.

If the tag content is not valid JSON, or any parsed value is not an object with a `"type"` string, `markdownToAdf` will throw an error.

⚠️ Please note
- `<adf>` can appear either as a block-level element (surrounded by blank lines) or inline within a paragraph, list item, table cell, etc. Inline placement embeds the ADF node(s) into the surrounding paragraph content:

  ```markdown
  See the <adf>{"type":"inlineCard","attrs":{"url":"https://example.com"}}</adf> card above.

  | Status | Notes |
  | --- | --- |
  | <adf>{"type":"emoji","attrs":{"shortName":":white_check_mark:","text":"✅"}}</adf> Done | All good |
  ```
- The embedded ADF nodes are not processed or validated by this library. They are passed through verbatim into the output document. This means that you are responsible for ensuring that the embedded ADF is valid and correctly structured for your use case.
- Placing an `<adf>` tag inside a Markdown link (e.g. `[text <adf>...</adf>](https://example.com)`) is not supported and the behaviour is undefined. ADF does not allow non-text inline nodes (such as `mention` or `date`) to carry a `link` mark, so there is no valid ADF representation for this construct.

## API Reference

### `markdownToAdf(markdown: string): AdfDocument`

Converts a Markdown string to an ADF document object (JSON serialisable).

### Types

```typescript
type AdfNode = {
    type: string;
    attrs?: Record<string, any>;
    content?: AdfNode[];
    marks?: AdfMark[];
    text?: string;
};

type AdfMark = {
    type: string;
    attrs?: Record<string, any>;
};

type AdfDocument = {
    version: 1;
    type: 'doc';
    content: AdfNode[];
};
```

## Caveats

Marklassian aims to provide a lightweight, fast and mostly accurate conversion from Markdown to ADF.

If you have complex Markdown or require strict conformance to the ADF format, you may need want to use the official Atlassian libraries. These are hefty dependencies that may bloat your project and require manual tree shaking.

The following example demonstrates how to use the official Atlassian libraries for Markdown to ADF conversion:

```javascript
import { defaultSchema } from '@atlaskit/adf-schema';
import { JSONTransformer } from '@atlaskit/editor-json-transformer';
import { MarkdownTransformer } from '@atlaskit/editor-markdown-transformer';

const jsonTransformer = new JSONTransformer();
const markdownTransformer = new MarkdownTransformer(defaultSchema);

const markdownDocument = '';
const adfDocument = jsonTransformer.encode(markdownTransformer.parse(markdownDocument));
```
